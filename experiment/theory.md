<u><h3>Theory</h3></u>
Solidity is a high-level programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 
It is the most commonly used language for Ethereum development. Solidity is similar to JavaScript in terms of syntax, and it allows developers
 to define the logic and behavior of smart contracts.
