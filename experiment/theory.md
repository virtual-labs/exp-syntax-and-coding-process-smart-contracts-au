<h3>Theory</h3>

<p>
Solidity is a high-level, contract-oriented programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 
It allows developers to define the logic, rules, and behavior of decentralized applications (dApps). Its syntax is similar to JavaScript, making it 
accessible for developers with basic programming experience.
</p>

<p>
A <strong>smart contract</strong> is a self-executing program that runs on the blockchain. Once deployed, it automatically executes predefined 
rules, enabling tasks such as transactions, asset management, and data verification without intermediaries. Understanding smart contracts requires knowledge 
of Solidity syntax and blockchain concepts, including <strong>transactions and gas fees</strong>.

<h4>Hands-On Focus of This Experiment:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Conditional statements and loops:</strong> 
    Students will write contracts using <code>if-else</code> statements and loops (<code>for</code>, <code>while</code>) to control program flow.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Contracts as classes:</strong> 
    Learn to define contracts with state variables, functions, and constructors, simulating real-world objects.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Transactions and gas fees:</strong> 
    Students will execute functions that modify contract state, and observe the associated gas fees required for each operation. 
    This helps understand how computation and storage cost are handled on the Ethereum blockchain.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Practical applications:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Car Rental – implement rental agreements and payments between parties.</li>
      <li>Land Buy/Sell – simulate ownership transfers and contract-based verification.</li>
      <li>KYC Verification – create a contract to validate and store identity information securely.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Students will use the <strong>Remix IDE</strong> to write, compile, deploy, and test their contracts in a simulated environment. 
This hands-on approach helps learners gain practical experience with Solidity programming and understand how contracts function on the blockchain.
