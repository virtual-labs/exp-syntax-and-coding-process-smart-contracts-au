<h3>Aim of the Experiment</h3>  
<p>The primary objective of this experiment is to understand fundamental concepts of smart contracts using Solidity. This includes:</p>  
<ul>  
  <li>Exploring <b>if</b> conditions and looping structures in Solidity.</li>  
  <li>Understanding <b>classes</b> and <b>objects</b> within the context of smart contracts.</li>  
</ul>  
<p>The experiment aims to provide hands-on experience with Solidity programming, helping to build a strong foundation in writing and deploying smart contracts.</p>
