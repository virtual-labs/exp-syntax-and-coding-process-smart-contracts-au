### Aim of the Experiment

The aim of this experiment is to understand the fundamental programming constructs of Solidity smart contracts. This includes learning the syntax of Solidity, exploring conditional statements (`if-else`) and looping structures, understanding the concept of contracts as classes and objects, gaining initial exposure to transactions and gas fees, and applying these concepts by coding simple applications such as Car Rental, Land Buy/Sell, and KYC Verification for hands-on experience.
